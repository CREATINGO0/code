the white-box testing is done by the if(DEBUG)
part. the idea comes from some macro of c++ or
something. you define a flag indicating the
mode of the code and some certain parts of code
which shows how the program is working is
executed iff the flag is labelled 'debug mode'
and they are skipped during normal running.
compared with those accomplished by macro, such
method in c may take extra resources even if
they are not doing anything in actural running.
another problem is that they may be mixed up
with those code which are doing the job and it
is sometimes confusing. but after all, it makes
life easier than commenting out testing parts
especially when you have hundreds of lines of
such code. 

the black-box test is done with the provided
code and the submit system on the server. i
have to admit that this is some cheating trick
since i have only developed a simple main()
which only feeds some simple sentences. in
fact my very first plan is to write a
prototype and finish that with the response on
the server, and it turned out to be quicker
when the drv* are released. it is true that
testing is of equal importance as developing
or even higher if you are working on some
vital project.
